# Tm Schedule Architecture

## The big idea in plain words {#picture}

**Case-study provenance:** the original TM Schedule source and endpoint contract were not supplied. These are illustrative schedule flows with synthetic data, not a verified inventory of that private application.

Learning is like climbing stairs. You can only reach the third step if the first two are solid.

## What you will be able to do {#outcomes}

Read this after the previous numbered lesson. Use synthetic notes and local exercise data. By the end you should explain the following scope without copying:

Trace the real schedule application from browser click through controller, service, repository, memory/Oracle, and response.

## Words to know {#vocabulary}

- **prerequisite**: something you need to know first, before the next thing makes sense.

- **checkpoint**: a question you answer from memory, without peeking.

- **contract**: a clear promise about what goes in and what comes out.

## Why this idea exists {#history}

If you try to memorize a whole framework before you ever run one small example, most of it slips away. Learning in small loops (read, guess, try, check, review) shows you exactly which step you missed.

## Concept 1 {#concept-1}

prerequisite means something you need to know first, before the next thing makes sense. Read the prerequisites before you run a framework example.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 2 {#concept-2}

Guess the output first, then look at the answer.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 3 {#concept-3}

When a test fails, it points to the idea you are missing.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 4 {#concept-4}

A practice score in this app is just a helper, not an official exam grade.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Going deeper: the technical walkthrough {#walkthrough}

### The one-minute picture


An API is a controlled doorway. A client asks for something using an agreed
language. The server checks the request, applies rules, reads or writes data,
and returns an answer.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant C as Client
    participant A as API
    participant S as Service rules
    participant D as Database
    U->>C: Click save
    C->>A: POST /notes with JSON
    A->>A: Bind and validate
    A->>S: Call use case
    S->>D: Save with parameters
    D-->>S: Saved record
    S-->>A: Response model
    A-->>C: 201 Created or safe error
    C-->>U: Show result
```

The API contract is the menu. It tells a client which requests are allowed and
what answers mean. The implementation may change behind the contract.



## Worked scenario {#worked-scenario}

You understand how to ask for data with GET, but you cannot explain how the server checks incoming data. What should you study next?

The justified choice is **Practice sending bad data and see how the server checks it**. Select **review-validation** in the structured practical and explain why. Alternatives ignore a requirement, cross a trust boundary, or invent success.

### Structured decision contract

```json

{
  "decision": "review-validation",
  "justification": "The prerequisite and checkpoint boundary must preserve the declared contract and ownership.",
  "failureBehavior": "Expose a safe failure and recover through the boundary owner."
}

```

Decision selects one declared behavior. Justification explains the boundary. FailureBehavior explains the observable error and recovery owner. These fields never execute commands. Required terms and minimum lengths form a basic practice rubric, not semantic grading.

## Step-by-step flow and matching picture {#flow}

```

## Three real-life uses {#use-cases}

1. A personal learner applies this rule to one synthetic note and checks the result.
2. A team changes the boundary while preserving its shared request and response contract.
3. A deployed library handles concurrent requests and reports failures through safe errors and correlated signals.

## What can go wrong, and how to stay safe {#failure-security}

Come back to a topic after a break; remembering it is better practice than just re-reading it. An external dependency needs an owner, size limit, deadline, cleanup, and recovery path. Return a stable error code rather than raw exceptions. Redact credentials and private bodies in diagnostics.

The abstraction improves prerequisite reasoning but adds configuration and lifecycle work. Keep a simpler implementation when it meets the requirement. Measure the limiting resource before adding services, queues, or caches.

## Practice lab and expected observation {#practice}

1. Predict the scenario decision before opening Practical. Explain each rejected alternative.
2. Run a relevant example above in an isolated exercise project. Record the expected result, then change one input to an invalid or boundary value. A failed assertion or deliberate error should replace silent success.
3. Submit the structured decision. Initially the checks fail. After selecting review-validation and writing an explanation and failure plan, all three pass. Follow the indicated review section for missed checks.

### Broken example to debug

```json

{"decision":"trust-client","justification":"","failureBehavior":""}

```

This ignores the responsible boundary and gives no reasoning or recovery. Correct the fields rather than changing the validator.

## Checkpoint and definition of done {#checkpoint}

- [ ] Define prerequisite and checkpoint without looking.
- [ ] Trace input to owner and output.
- [ ] Explain one failure and one alternative.
- [ ] Pass at least four assignment questions.
- [ ] Pass every practical check and submit.
- [ ] Explain the concept again tomorrow.

## Sources, versions, and safe commands {#sources}

HTTP semantics; educational contracts, not an audit of the unavailable TM Schedule repository. Review date: 2026-10-02. The supplied blueprint is the teaching source; official landing pages were checked where reachable. No provider or original TM Schedule deployment was tested.
