# Capstone Study Notes Api

## The big idea in plain words {#picture}

Architecture is a map of the building: which room belongs to whom and which doors connect them.

## What you will be able to do {#outcomes}

Read this after the previous numbered lesson. Use synthetic notes and local exercise data. By the end you should explain the following scope without copying:

Build a complete typed Express API with auth boundary, CRUD, persistence, streams, tests, and operations.

## Words to know {#vocabulary}

- **monolith**: an app that is built and shipped as one piece.

- **port**: a doorway where your app talks to the outside.

- **saga**: a chain of steps where each step has an 'undo' step.

## Why this idea exists {#history}

One tangled program is risky to change, but splitting into many services adds network and deployment work. Start with tidy parts inside one program, and split only when you must.

## Concept 1 {#concept-1}

monolith means an app that is built and shipped as one piece. A modular monolith can have clear owners without network calls.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 2 {#concept-2}

Split into a service only when you truly need to scale or release it separately.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 3 {#concept-3}

An outbox keeps messages safe until they are sent.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Concept 4 {#concept-4}

CQRS splits reading and writing, and brings extra coordination.

Apply this rule to the Study Notes boundary before choosing syntax. Name the input, owner, and observable result. The scenario below gives a concrete decision to check.

## Going deeper: the technical walkthrough {#walkthrough}

### Complete learning project


Build a Study Notes API with:

```text
GET    /health
GET    /notes
GET    /notes/:id
POST   /notes
PUT    /notes/:id
DELETE /notes/:id
```

Requirements:

- TypeScript and a locked package manager;
- bounded JSON input and pagination;
- route, service, repository, and database boundaries;
- safe error body and request ID;
- authorization rule, even if the first user is synthetic;
- unit, HTTP, and persistence tests;
- health check, structured logs, graceful shutdown, and README curl examples.



## Worked scenario {#worked-scenario}

A small team builds a simple CRUD app and has no separate scaling problem. What should it start with?

The justified choice is **A modular monolith with clear ports**. Select **modular-monolith** in the structured practical and explain why. Alternatives ignore a requirement, cross a trust boundary, or invent success.

### Structured decision contract

```json

{
  "decision": "modular-monolith",
  "justification": "The monolith and port boundary must preserve the declared contract and ownership.",
  "failureBehavior": "Expose a safe failure and recover through the boundary owner."
}

```

Decision selects one declared behavior. Justification explains the boundary. FailureBehavior explains the observable error and recovery owner. These fields never execute commands. Required terms and minimum lengths form a basic practice rubric, not semantic grading.

## Step-by-step flow and matching picture {#flow}

```

## Three real-life uses {#use-cases}

1. A personal learner applies this rule to one synthetic note and checks the result.
2. A team changes the boundary while preserving its shared request and response contract.
3. A deployed library handles concurrent requests and reports failures through safe errors and correlated signals.

## What can go wrong, and how to stay safe {#failure-security}

A saga fixes mistakes with undo steps, not one magic rollback. An external dependency needs an owner, size limit, deadline, cleanup, and recovery path. Return a stable error code rather than raw exceptions. Redact credentials and private bodies in diagnostics.

The abstraction improves monolith reasoning but adds configuration and lifecycle work. Keep a simpler implementation when it meets the requirement. Measure the limiting resource before adding services, queues, or caches.

## Practice lab and expected observation {#practice}

1. Predict the scenario decision before opening Practical. Explain each rejected alternative.
2. Run a relevant example above in an isolated exercise project. Record the expected result, then change one input to an invalid or boundary value. A failed assertion or deliberate error should replace silent success.
3. Submit the structured decision. Initially the checks fail. After selecting modular-monolith and writing an explanation and failure plan, all three pass. Follow the indicated review section for missed checks.

### Broken example to debug

```json

{"decision":"trust-client","justification":"","failureBehavior":""}

```

This ignores the responsible boundary and gives no reasoning or recovery. Correct the fields rather than changing the validator.

## Checkpoint and definition of done {#checkpoint}

- [ ] Define monolith and port without looking.
- [ ] Trace input to owner and output.
- [ ] Explain one failure and one alternative.
- [ ] Pass at least four assignment questions.
- [ ] Pass every practical check and submit.
- [ ] Explain the concept again tomorrow.

## Sources, versions, and safe commands {#sources}

Node 22 baseline; ESM modules. Review date: 2026-10-02. The supplied blueprint is the teaching source; official landing pages were checked where reachable. No provider or original TM Schedule deployment was tested.
